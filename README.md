# Assertion-Based-Verification-of-an-AI-Accelerator-Core
This project implements formal and simulation-based assertion verification for a multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit used in AI accelerators. It ensures that key pipeline behaviors and computation constraints are met using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), improving design reliability and easing debug effort in functional verification.
